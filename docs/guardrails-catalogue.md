Computational controls only. **Feedforward** constrains generation;
**feedback** verifies output. Tool choices below are current defaults, not
commitments — check the bundles for what is actually wired up.

## Highest leverage for agentic work

Auto-fix formatters give the best return per hour spent: run one as a hook
rather than a check and style drift becomes impossible rather than merely
reviewable.

Mutation testing catches what coverage cannot. Agents readily produce tests
that assert nothing, and only PIT or mutmut will notice; gate it on changed
files to keep the cost tolerable.

Python has no compiler enforcing structure, so import-linter's declared layer
contracts are the only thing standing between an agent and architectural
drift. Set them up before the first agent session, not after.

Codegen from spec turns hallucinated APIs into compile or type errors:
generating DTOs and clients from OpenAPI or Avro converts an inferential
failure mode into a computational one.

## Stack asymmetry

Java gets a great deal free from the compiler, so marginal effort goes on
architecture and semantics: ArchUnit, PIT, japicmp. Python starts with nothing
deterministic, so strict typing plus Ruff plus import-linter is the floor
before anything else is worth adding.
