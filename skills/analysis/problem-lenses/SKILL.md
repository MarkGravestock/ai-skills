description: Seven lenses for analysing a problem before building it — impact mapping, Wardley mapping, specification by example, domain storytelling, event storming, domain-driven design, systems thinking. Use whenever work is starting and the problem is not yet clear: vague or contested requirements, an unfamiliar domain, arguments about scope, build-vs-buy calls, a bug or complaint that keeps coming back, or a request to frame a problem, run discovery, model a domain, find bounded contexts, map impacts, or work out what to build first. Routes to the one lens that answers the question actually blocking progress, rather than running all seven.

# Problem lenses

Seven ways of looking at a problem before committing to a solution. Each answers a
different question. The value is in picking the one that answers the question you are
actually stuck on — running all seven is the ceremony this repo exists to avoid.

Full technique, worked examples and failure modes: [lenses.md](lenses.md). Read the entry
for the lens you pick; don't read all seven.

## Route by the question

| The question you're stuck on | Lens |
|---|---|
| Why are we doing this at all? What behaviour change would count as success? | Impact mapping |
| Where do we invest? What should we build, buy, or wait for? | Wardley mapping |
| How does this work actually happen today, and who does it? | Domain storytelling |
| What happens in this process over time, and where are the seams? | Event storming |
| What are the concepts really called, and where does one model stop being true? | Domain-driven design |
| What exactly does "done" mean for this rule? | Specification by example |
| Why does this keep coming back no matter what we fix? | Systems thinking |

If two rows fit, you have two problems — take the one that blocks the next slice.

## Picking well

The failure mode is reaching for the lens you like rather than the one that fits. Some
tells:

- Arguing about features → you have a goal problem, not a feature problem. Impact
  mapping. The argument usually dissolves once the behaviour change is named.
- Arguing about edge cases in the abstract → stop arguing and write the examples.
  Specification by example turns an opinion fight into a table you can check.
- Nobody can agree what a word means ("what counts as an *active* rider?") → DDD.
  Two definitions usually means two bounded contexts, not one confused team.
- The domain is unfamiliar and you're guessing → domain storytelling first. It is the
  gentlest lens: people tell you what they do, you draw it back at them.
- The process is known but tangled, and you suspect the boundaries are wrong → event
  storming.
- Every fix creates a new problem somewhere else → systems thinking. You are pushing
  on a symptom while a feedback loop pushes back.
- The debate is build vs buy, or "is this our differentiator?" → Wardley mapping.

## How they compose

They are not a pipeline, but some pairs are genuinely strong:

- **Impact mapping → specification by example.** The deliverable at the bottom of an
  impact map is the thing to write key examples for. Both are Adzic, and they meet here.
- **Domain storytelling → event storming.** Stories give you the vocabulary and the actors;
  event storming then puts the timeline and the boundaries on it.
- **Event storming → DDD.** Clusters of events and commands that share a common noun are
  aggregate candidates; the seams between clusters are bounded-context candidates.
- **Wardley mapping → systems thinking.** Both reason about the whole; Wardley adds
  evolution over time, which is what makes "we'll build our own" look different in year
  three.

Two flows worth knowing, one for each common starting point:

- **New product, unclear value**: impact mapping (why/who) → Wardley (where to invest) →
  spec by example (what done means for the first slice).
- **Existing system, unclear domain**: domain storytelling (how it works now) → event
  storming (timeline and seams) → DDD (language and boundaries).

Stop as soon as the next slice is obvious. The point of a lens is to unblock Decide, not to
produce a document.

## Keep it inside the loop

These lenses serve **Orient** in the OODA delivery loop (`practices/delivery-process.md` in
the ai-development repo). That has consequences worth holding onto:

- One lens, one artefact, then back to building. A walking skeleton usually teaches you
  more than a second workshop would.
- The artefact is scaffolding, not a deliverable. An impact map that stops being true is
  meant to be redrawn, not maintained.
- Prefer the lens that produces something executable. Key examples become tests, which is
  a computational control; a diagram is an inferential one that decays as context grows.
- If the analysis is longer than the slice it unblocks, you are building a spec workflow —
  the exact ceremony the guardrails thesis argues against, and the evidence there is that
  it buys almost nothing for a lot of wall-clock time.

## Handing off to the design skills

Analysis ends where construction begins. What each lens hands over:

| Lens output | Skill that picks it up |
|---|---|
| Ubiquitous language, domain terms | `naming` |
| Bounded contexts, context map | `coupling-analysis` |
| Aggregates, invariants | `validation-review`, `cupid-properties` |
| Key examples | `bug-magnet` and the stack testing skills |
| A chosen slice, ready to plan | `plan-eng-review` |
